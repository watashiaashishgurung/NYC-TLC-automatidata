# **Automatidata Project: Predicting Customer Tipping Behavior**

## **Introduction**
The **Automatidata Project** is a data science initiative undertaken as part of the "Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning" course. As a data professional at **Automatidata**, a data consulting firm, you have been approached by the **New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (NYC TLC)** to develop a machine learning model. The goal is to predict whether a taxi passenger will leave a tip or not. This predictive model will be integrated into a taxi driver app to help drivers optimize their earning potential, as tips are a crucial part of their income.

## **Project Objectives**
1. **Revenue Optimization** – Assist taxi drivers in identifying potential tippers and increasing their earnings.
2. **Model Development** – Build a machine learning model using tree-based algorithms to predict customer tipping behavior.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Identify key factors influencing tipping behavior and transform raw data into actionable insights.
4. **Ethical Considerations** – Evaluate the fairness and impact of such a predictive system to avoid potential biases and ethical concerns.

## **Project Structure**
This project follows a structured approach in three key phases:

### **1. Ethical Considerations**
- Evaluate the fairness of predicting tipping behavior.
- Assess the impact of false positives (predicting a tip when none is given) and false negatives (predicting no tip when one is given).
- Consider alternative objectives, such as predicting the most generous tippers instead of identifying non-tippers.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- Extract and transform relevant features from the dataset, including:
  - Pickup and drop-off locations
  - Payment method
  - Trip distance and duration
  - Time of day and day of the week
  - Fare amount and additional charges
- Engineer new variables that improve model performance, such as categorizing trips based on fare ranges or identifying frequent tipping behaviors.

### **3. Modeling & Evaluation**
- Implement **tree-based machine learning models**, including:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
  - **XGBoost Classifier**
- Tune hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** to optimize model performance.
- Evaluate models using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score** to balance predictive power and fairness.
- Analyze model outcomes, feature importance, and make recommendations for improvement.

## **Expected Outcomes**
- A predictive model capable of identifying customers likely to tip generously.
- Insights into key factors that influence tipping behavior.
- Ethical recommendations to ensure fair and unbiased deployment of the model.
- A final report summarizing the findings, model performance, and potential improvements.

## **Conclusion**
This project offers an opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world data with practical implications. While the model can help taxi drivers maximize their earnings, it is essential to address ethical concerns and ensure fair treatment of all customers. The final decision on deploying the model should consider its societal impact alongside predictive accuracy.
